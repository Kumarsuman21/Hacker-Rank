A bunch of rectangles are drawn and the area of their intersection is asked.

    while(no_of_steps-- != 0)
    {
        scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
        final_intersection_a = min(final_intersection_a, a);
        final_intersection_b = min(final_intersection_b, b);
    }
    final_area = final_intersection_a*1L*final_intersection_b;
