Let's look at the first row - 

T(1, c) = 2*(c - 1)

Now consider any element T(r, c). 

If r is odd, then T(r, c) = T(1, c) + 10*(r - 1) i.e. - it is at an offset of 10 by each pair of rows.

If r is even, then T(r, c) = T(1, c) + 10*(r - 1) + 1,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This can be concisely written as - 

number = 2*(column - 1) + ( (row - 1)/2 )*10 + (row - 1)%2
