This is an invariants problem !

If a number divides two numbers, it must also divide their difference. 

gcd(u, v) = gcd(u, u-v)

It is quite easy to see that 
gcd(a, b) = gcd(a + b, b) = gcd(a, a + b) = gcd(a - b, b) = gcd(a, b - a)

The gcd is invariant. It is not possible to go from (a, b) to (x, y) if gcd(a, b) =/= gcd(x, y)

If the gcd's are equal, we make enough moves to go to (gcd, gcd) and then from there go to (x, y).

I used the Binary GCD algorithm - 
	I forgot that the base case of this is gcd(0, v) = v, because often 0 is reached without going through 1. Base case must have 0 and not 1.
