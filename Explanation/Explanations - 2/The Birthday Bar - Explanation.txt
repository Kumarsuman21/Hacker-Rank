We only need consecutive sums. So, that simplifies things. 

for(i = 1; i <= n; i++)
	sum += (i <= m ? s[i] : s[i] - s[i-m])

	if(i >= m && sum == d)
		no_of_pieces++

We keep track of the sum of all elements in the array. Once we exceed the m-th number, subtract the (i-m)-th number so that the sum only contains m consecutive numbers.
While checking if sum = d, it is important to check that i >= m, other we may get a sum = d, with less than m consecutive squares.
