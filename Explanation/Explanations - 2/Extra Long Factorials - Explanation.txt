Store it in an array and multiply keeping track of carry and first digit.

            replace = product%base; //Replace is what should be rewritten in the ith digit
            carry = product/base; //Carry needs to be added when num is multiplied with the next most significant digit

            //The ith digit of number is rewritten now as the product%base we're working in. This case - 10
            number[i] = replace;

            //If there is a carry in the MSB, then the number of digits will increase. For example, 112x10 = 1120. There is a carry in the MSB.
            if( (i == first_digit) && (carry > 0) )
