Andrew's answer is correct if - 

1. It is not a blank; and
2. It doesn't match Catherine.

    for(int i = 0; i < no_of_questions; i++)
    {
        if(vincent_answers[i] != '.' && vincent_answers[i] != catherine_answers[i])
            no_of_correct_answers++;
    }

    cout << no_of_correct_answers;
