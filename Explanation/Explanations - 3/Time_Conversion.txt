Check two cases - 

If it's PM, then 12 must be added to the number of hours if it isn't 12.

If it's AM and 12, then the number of hours must be set to 0.

     if(time[8] == 'A' && time[0] == '1' && time[1] == '2')
            time[0] = time[1] = '0';

    if(time[8] == 'P' && !(time[0] == '1' && time[1] == '2') )
            time[0]++, time[1] += 2;

    time[8] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", time);
