Given an array of  integers, find and print the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.

-------------------------------------------------------------

First sort and then see the maximum consecutive difference. The minimum absolute difference has to be between consecutive elements on the array.

min_difference  = 2e9 + 1;

for(i = 1; i < no_of_elements; i++)
        min_difference = min(min_difference, array[i] - array[i-1]);

    cout << min_difference;
