Count the number of even divisors of n.

We can go through the divisors of n in O(root(n)) time. Just apply a parity test. 
Also, notice that an odd number has no even divisor.

If i divides n, then check if i is even and if (n/i) is even. If both are even increase the count by 2. Else by 1.
The exception is when i^2 = n, Here i and n/i are the same number so it shouldn't be increased by 1. 

    if(n%2 == 0)
        for(i = 1; i*i <= n; i++)
        {
            if(n%i == 0)
            {
                if(i*i != n && i%2 == 0 && (n/i)%2 == 0)
                    number_of_even_factors +=2;
                else if(i%2 == 0 || (n%i) == 0)
                    number_of_even_factors++;
            }
        }
