Use the following greedy algorithm - 

	If a contest is not important, lose it.
	Put all important contests into a list and sort it in descending order of luck.
		Lose the first k contests of this list (since it will be the k-luckiest contests) and win the remaining contests.

   for(i = 1; i <= no_of_contests; i++)
   {
       scanf("%d %d", &luck, &importance);

       total_luck += (importance == 0 ? luck : 0); //Lose all unimportant contests.
       if(importance == 1)
       {
           luck_of_important_contests[no_of_important_contests++] = luck;
       }
   }

   selection_sort(luck_of_important_contests, no_of_important_contests); //In descending order

   for(i = 0; i < no_of_important_contests; i++) //Lose as many contests as possible. Choose the k-luckiest contests to lose
   {
       total_luck += (i < no_of_affordable_losses ? luck_of_important_contests[i] : (0 - luck_of_important_contests[i]) );
   }
