In a palindrome of odd length, only the middle element can occur an odd number of times.
All other elements must occur in pairs.

A string of even length cannot have only one element an odd number of times (else the string would be of odd length). 

-----------------------------------------------

It is sufficient to check that the count of at most one element is an odd number. 
(If the string has an odd number of elements, the middle element will have odd count. If string length is even, there can't be only 1 element an odd number of times.)

    for(i = 0; string[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        alphabet_count[string[i] - 'a']++;
    }

    for(i = 0; i < NO_OF_ALPHABETS; i++)
    {
        if(alphabet_count[i]%2 == 1)
        {
            no_of_odd_alphabets++;

            if(no_of_odd_alphabets > 1) break; //A palindrome can have odd occurrences of at most 1 character
        }
    }
