Two players are playing a game on a  chessboard. The rules of the game are as follows:

The game starts with a single coin located at some  coordinate. The coordinate of the upper left cell is , and the coordinate of the lower right cell is .
In each move, a player must move the coin from cell  to one of the following locations:

Note: The coin must remain inside the confines of the board.

The players move in alternating turns. The first player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

The figure below shows all four possible moves:

(x-2, y+1)  
(x-2, y-1) 
(x+1, y-2) 
(x-1, y-2)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

If the coin is moved from (x, y) to (x1, y1), then the first player is second player from (x1, y1).
From the current position, check if it is possible to move to a square winning for second player.
If no move is possible, a loss in unavoidable. 
	For convenience - All illegal squares are winning for first player by extension ... 
	(Doing this frees us from defining base cases - squares winning for player 2 by default because no legal moves will be available from there)

A 'Previous' Player becomes the 'Next' Player after making a move. If he moves to a square which is winning for 'Next' Player, he wins.

    if(x < 1 || x > 15 || y < 1 || y > 15) //Mark illegal positions as winning for Player 1 for convenience.
        return 1;

    if(winner[x][y] == 0)
    {
	if(find_winner(x-2, y+1) == 2 || find_winner(x-2, y-1) == 2 || find_winner(x+1, y-2) == 2 || find_winner(x-1, y-2) == 2)
            winner[x][y] = 1;
        else
            winner[x][y] = 2;
    }
