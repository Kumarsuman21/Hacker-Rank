Given an integer, n, find each x such that:

1. 0<= x <= n
2. x XOR n = x + n

where  denotes the bitwise XOR operator. Then print an integer denoting the total number of x's satisfying the criteria above.

Input Format

A single integer, n .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XOR(a, b) is addition of a and b mod 2 {where a and b are single bits - either 0 or 1}.

Apply the following procedure to n.

Write a 0 wherever there is a 1.
Write an x wherever there is a 0.

for n = 10, we get 0x0x,

Now any binary combination of these x's gives us a number which - 
1. Has no bits set in the same position as n
2. Has the same length as n.

So, performing XOR and addition on these numbers gives us the same result. 

So, the number of such numbers is 2^{Number of 0 bits in n}
