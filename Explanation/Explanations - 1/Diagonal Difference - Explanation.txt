Given a square matrix of size , calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, . The next  lines denote the matrix's rows, with each line containing space-separated integers describing the columns.

Constraints

Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.

There isn't any need to store the matrix. 
REad it like a matrix

i = 1 to n
	j = 1 t0 n
		Read element
		
		if(i = j), add element to diagonal sum
		if(i + j = n + 1) add element to anti diagonal sum

Print abs(diagonal_sum - anti_diagonal_sum)
