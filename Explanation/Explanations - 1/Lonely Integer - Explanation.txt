Consider an array of  integers, , where all but one of the integers occur in pairs. In other words, every element in  occurs exactly twice except for one unique element.

Given , find and print the unique element.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of integers in the array. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective values in .

Constraints

It is guaranteed that  is an odd number.
, where .
Output Format

Print the unique number that occurs only once in  on a new line.

Imagine all the numbers are written in their binary forms. The bits that are set in this number  will be set an even number of times.

For example, 5 - 101. If 5 occurs twice, the bits at the first and third position will occur atleast twice.

So, when we apply bitwise XOR over all the numbers, the only bits that remain set belong to the lonely integer since it doesn't have any counterpart to 'neutralise' it.

The answer is the bitwise XOR of all the numbers.
