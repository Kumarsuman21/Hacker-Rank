
Here's the strategy ... First, each friend buys one flower, then after every one has bought one flower only then someone buys their second flower. 

The idea is that we try to increase the base price of the flowers by as little as possible.

Now, the friends start buying the flowers from the most expensive so that the less expensive flowers have their price multiplied.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define all(v) (v).begin(), (v).end()
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int no_of_people, no_of_flowers;
    cin >> no_of_flowers >> no_of_people;
    
    vector<int> cost(no_of_flowers);
    for(int i = 0; i < no_of_flowers; i++) cin >> cost[i];
    
    sort(all(cost));
    reverse(all(cost));
    
    int minimum_cost = 0, flower_no = 0;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < no_of_flowers; i++)
    {
        flower_no += (i%no_of_people == 0);
        
        minimum_cost += flower_no*cost[i];
    }
    
    cout << minimum_cost;
    return 0;
}
